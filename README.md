**COVID-19 Community Level Analysis by County**

**Project Overview**

This project involves a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 impact at the community level within three distinct states in the United States: California, Virginia, and Idaho. These states were selected to represent a range of populations - highest, medium, and lowest, respectively. Utilizing the "United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County" dataset, this project aims to uncover trends, key metrics, and insights regarding COVID-19 hospital admissions, inpatient bed utilization, and case rates over time.

**Data Source**

The analysis is based on the publicly available dataset from the United States public health database, specifically the "United States COVID-19 Community Levels by County" dataset. This dataset includes detailed metrics on COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions, bed utilization, and other significant indicators at the county level. Please see the https://data.cdc.gov/Public-Health-Surveillance/United-States-COVID-19-Community-Levels-by-County/3nnm-4jni/about_data link for more details about the dataset.


**Libraries Used**

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical computations.
Matplotlib: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
calendar: For handling operations related to calendar dates.

**Key Findings**

Trend Analysis: The project reveals the monthly trends of COVID-19 hospital admissions and bed utilization across the three states. It helps identify peak periods and assess the healthcare burden during different phases of the pandemic.

State-wise Comparison: By analyzing states with different population sizes, the project highlights how population density may influence COVID-19 spread and healthcare system strain.

Unique County Insights: For each state, the analysis provides insights into the number of unique counties affected, showcasing the geographical spread and reach of the pandemic within each state.

Correlation Assessment: The study examines the correlation between different COVID-19 metrics, providing insights into how different factors may be interrelated.

**Usage**

Detailed instructions on how to run the Python scripts for data analysis, including data loading, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization steps. Include information on any prerequisites or dependencies required for running the scripts.

**Visualizations**

The repository includes bar charts, line charts, and pie charts representing various COVID-19 metrics across the three states. These visualizations aid in understanding the data at a glance and make comparisons between different time periods and geographical locations.

**Conclusion**

Summarize the key takeaways from the analysis and any recommendations or implications for public health policies based on the findings.
